# SPOTIFY
The company I have chosen is called Spotify. It is one of the most familiar streaming services in the world. for most people in the world. Spotify has a very interesting beginning. Founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, are actually Swedish. Spotify came from small beginnings, established in 2006. The idea for Spotify emerged as a solution to the growing problem of online music piracy that was rampant in the mid-2000s.
